A rudimentary mapping program in Java. Given a data set representing the roads and intersections in a specific geographic region, this program plots a map of the data and provides the shortest path directions between any two arbitrary intersections. Sample maps include the University of Rochester Campus, Monroe Country, and New York state.

How to run:
Compile:
	java *.java
Run:
	java StreetMap map.txt [--show] [--directions startIntersection endIntersection]
